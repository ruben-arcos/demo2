// A square of squares

  // You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
  //And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

  // However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an 
  //ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're 
  //currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of
  //building blocks is a perfect square.

  // Task
  // Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    // In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer  
    //that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product 
    //of some integer with itself.

  // The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about 
  //that in dynamic typed languages.

  // Examples
    // -1  =>  false
    //  0  =>  true
    //  3  =>  false
    //  4  =>  true
    // 25  =>  true
    // 26  =>  false
